### Notes

As mentioned before, my emulator moves extremely slowly. You'll notice in the walkthrough that the emulator lags and doesnt load the video trailers. I actually got the trailers to work but they only load sometimes. I'm not sure how to increase the speed of the emulator.

### Notes
My biggest challenge was testing my code on the emulator. My emulator runs very slowly, therefore, it takes a very long time to check if my code is working.
